## World Government Bonds Market Yield Project
In this repository, I devise a Database for World Government Bonds Market Yield, encompassing 25 countries in which include Indonesia. The objective of this repository is to explore the government bonds yields and observe their daily trend over the period January 2020 until August 2025, encapsulating both Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Era. Furthermore, this database can be utilized within Economics & Finance environment for analyzing various aspects of bonds yield, such as Bonds Spread between Indonesia and US 10-Year Government Bond Yields to measure risk premium.  

There are several tools that I implement in executing the project for this repository, including:
- Pandas: cleaning and merging bonds yield data for different maturity time into single file (note: the creation of this Python Code is supported by ChatGPT),
- Power Query: Merging all cleansed bonds yield data for 25 countries
- MS SQL Server: Main Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) for devising the database.
